# Hangman Game

Hangman game to play in the console. Did this following along the tutorial on Youtube by David Battersby.
If you want to learn more about Ruby his channel is great. 

This project was to make a hangman simulation. I followed the tutorial, but also went off topic abit and added some of my own small features. It is entirely programmed in Ruby and works just like the original game.

Please open a pull request if you have any advice on the code.
